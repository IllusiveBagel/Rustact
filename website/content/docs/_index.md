Pick the track that matches what you need:

-   **Build** – start with the Tutorial for a fresh project or the Developer Guide if you are working inside the repo.
-   **Reference** – Architecture, Styling, and API Docs cover every exported type.
-   **Project** – Roadmap and Template docs explain where the library is headed and how to extend the starter kit.

Every link here opens directly—no more hopping between multiple pages.
